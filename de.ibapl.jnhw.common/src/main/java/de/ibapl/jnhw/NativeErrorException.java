/**
 * This exceptions is thrown if the jni native code detects an error. The error
 * number POSIX|ISO C call errno and Windows API call GetLastError() will be
 * stored in errno.
 * The value of errno is valid only if a called function sets the errno and flags the occurence of an error.
 * Once the call returns to the JVM the value of errno is uncertain, so this must be handled immediately after the call to that function.
